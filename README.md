# ArabicKeySwap ✨

Welcome to `ArabicKeySwap`—the handy solution for those moments when your keyboard language setting has a mind of its own, leaving you with Arabic characters instead of the intended English text. This script is your quick fix, turning that unintended Arabic text back into its English keyboard layout equivalent effortlessly.

## What is ArabicKeySwap? 🤔

`ArabicKeySwap` is a Python script designed to solve a common typing issue—typing in Arabic on an English keyboard layout by mistake. Instead of retyping everything, this tool allows you to convert the text back to what you originally intended, all with a simple command.

## Features 🚀

- **CLI Support**: Effortlessly convert text via the command line, interactively or through files.
- **Unicode Compatibility**: Full support for Unicode text ensures accurate conversions.
- **Ease of Use**: Simple commands and straightforward instructions cater to all users, technical or otherwise.

## Getting Started 🏁

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't already.

### Usage

To convert text directly from the command line:

```sh
python convert_to_english.py -t "يخسفيهخد"
```

For file-based text conversion:

```sh
python convert_to_english.py -f /path/to/your/file.txt
